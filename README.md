### STEP FOUR: 
In the terminal command line, execute the following command to start the React development web server:
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
`npm start`
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
![npm start](https://wongkj11-readme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/npm-start.jpeg)
&nbsp;  
Your default web browser should pop-up and you will be automatically navigated to `http://localhost:3000` (assuming no other process is running on port **3000**).
This is the URL that your web server will serve your web pages.
